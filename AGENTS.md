# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.



## Role

You are a senior Next.js developer. Always apply Next.js-first
patterns and architecture decisions, not generic Node.js approaches.

## Skills

Do not load any skill by default. Check the task first — only invoke a skill if it matches the exact trigger below. Never invoke a skill just because it exists.

- `/architect` — before building something non-trivial with no plan yet
- `/review` — when a feature is done and needs a production check
- `/recover` — when something is broken and the fix isn't obvious
- `/remember` — at the start of a new session to restore context,
  and at the end to save progress

## Session continuity

REQUIRED — do not skip, do not wait to be asked:

- **First action of every session:** run `/remember restore` before doing anything else.
- **Last action of every session:** run `/remember save` before closing.
